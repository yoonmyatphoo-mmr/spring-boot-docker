This project is a Spring Boot application packaged as a Docker container. It demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using Spring Boot and deploy it using Docker. The application can be easily run in any environment that supports Docker, providing a consistent setup and deployment process.

## ü™ì Built With
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## üî•Getting Started

### üìù Instructions
* Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd spring-boot-docker
```

* Build docker image
```sh
docker build -t spring-boot-docker .
```

* Run the Docker container:
```sh
docker build -t spring-boot-docker .
```
docker run -p 9090:8080 spring-boot-docker

* Check container
```sh
docker build -t spring-boot-docker .
```
docker ps

* check all containers including running container, not running container, unsuccessful running container
```sh
docker ps -a
```

* If you want to check running application logs or your output log values, you can type docker logs option.
```sh
docker logs -f -n 200 {container_id}
```

* If you want to delete your application container, you need to stop container first with above step.
  Please note that, it's better deleting unnecessary container or unsuccessful container as to reduce resource usage in your machine.

* if application is running, you need to stop with docker stop command first
```sh
docker rm {container_id}
```

* If you want to delete your application image, you need to stop and delete container first with above step.
  if container is still alive, you need to delete container first before deleting image
```sh
docker rmi {image_id}
```

* To remove all unused images (recommended way)
```sh
docker image prune
```

* To remove all unused networks
```sh
docker network prune
```

* To remove all unused volume (need to take care your volumes is used by other unactive containers which will use in future
```sh
docker volume prune
```

* To remove all unused containers, images and networks (including cache)
